## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

## Default Options

R Markdown works by typing regular text such as these words to describe **code chunks** you will execute.  A code chunk begins and ends with three back ticks.  With the opening three back ticks, you write: 

1. the type of code you will write (e.g., _**r**_), 
2. code chunk name if you wish, 
3. code chunk options.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Load Libraries

Here we load the libraries we need for this script.  If your computer did not already install these packages, then you need to install them first.  To install packages, you can either: 

1. type in your **Console** window _**install.packages("tidyverse")**_, or 
2. select the **Tools** menu option followed by **Install Packages...**.

```{r libraries, message=FALSE}
### Load libaries for use in current working session
## here for project work flow
library(here)

## tidyverse for data manipulation and plotting
# Loads eight different libraries simultaneously
library(tidyverse)

## GGally to extend ggplot2 capabilities
library(GGally)

## psych for correlation matrices
library(psych)

## broom to extract output cleanly from many statistical models including "lm"
library(broom) 

## knitr to produce pleasing tables
library(knitr) 
```

## Load Data

We set our working directory and load the _**simple_regression**_ data file from the working directory.

```{r data}
## use read_csv() and here() to import the data file
data <- read_csv(
  ## use here() to locate file in our project directory
  here("data", "covid_depaul.csv")
)
```

## Examine Data with Functions

Once you load in any data, then you will want to examine to check its basic features.  One way to do this in **RStudio** is by examining the data using the **Environment** window.  Alternatively, you can examine the data with the use of _R_ functions.

```{r structure}
## Examine the structure of your data
str(data)

# glimpse to preview the data
glimpse(data)

## Examine the top and bottom of a data object
# Use head function for the top of the data
head(data, n = 8)

# Use tail function for the bottom of the data
tail(data, n = 15)

```

## Scatterplots

We will generally use **ggplot2** functions or their extensions to produce plots. We produce a scatterplot for two variables.

```{r scatterplot}
### A minimally specified scatterplot using ggplot
## Specify the data and aesthetics
ggplot(data = data, mapping = aes(x = Popnsize, y = totalcases)) +
  ## Specify the geometry
  geom_point()

### A scatterplot with more specifications
## Specify the data and aesthetics
plot_1 <- ggplot(data = data, mapping = aes(x = Popnsize, y = totalcases)) +
  ## Specify the geometry with a color and shape
  geom_point(color = "red", shape = 18) +
  ## Set x-axis limits
  xlim(0, 50000000) +
  ## Set y-axis limits
  ylim(0, 2000000) +
  ## Change x-axis label
  xlab("Population size")

# display plot
plot_1

### save plots to folder in project directory
## save a single plot to a file
ggsave(
  ## file path
  here("plots", "plot_1.png"), 
  ## plot object
  plot = plot_1,
  ## dimensions
  units = "in", width = 9, height = 6
)
```

## Your Turn! 

In the empty code chunk, create a scatterplot with **Total cases** on the x-axis and **population size** on the y-axis.

Note: these Your Turn sections are purely for practice purposes

```{r your_turn_scatterplot}

```


## Scatterplot Matrix

We produce a scatterplot matrix in two ways:  

1. We use _**ggpairs**_ from **GGally**,
2. We select data with **dplyr**, and, then, plot.

```{r scatterplot_matrix}
### Use ggpairs function from GGally library
## Select desired columns
ggpairs(data = data, columns = 6:8)

### dplyr 
## We use the pipe, %>%, operator here,
## which passes information along to the next function
# Specify the data object
data %>%
  # Select variables
  select(Popnsize, totalcases, totaltest) %>%
  # Produce plot
  ggpairs()


## We can also use corr.test to get just a correlation matrix if we wish

# Specify the data object
  data %>%
  # Select variables
  select(Popnsize, totalcases, totaltest) %>%
  # Produce correlation matrix and significance tests
  corr.test()
```

## Fitting a Linear Model

We fit a simple linear regression model with _**lm**_, and we examine the results.

```{r lm}
### Linear models
## Linear model with unstandardized variables
myMod <- lm(totalcases ~ Popnsize, data = data)

## Linear model with standardized variables 
myModZ <- lm(scale(totalcases) ~ scale(Popnsize), data = data)
```

## Examine Results

We examine results with base functions, and, then, with functions from **broom**.

```{r lm_results}
#### Show output
### Reduced base output
## Undstandardized model
myMod

## Standardized model
myModZ

### Extended base output
## Unstandardized model
summary(myMod)

## Standardized model
summary(myModZ)

### Using broom for output
## Overall summary statistics for the model
# Unstandardized model
glance(myMod) 

# Standardized model
glance(myModZ)

## Regression coefficients for the model
# Unstandardized model
tidy(myMod)

# Standardized model
tidy(myModZ)
```

## Fitted and Residual Values

We examine fitted and residual values via base functions, and, then, with the _**augment**_ function from **broom**.

```{r augment}
### Base functions
## Fitted values for unstandardized model
fitted(myMod)

## Residual values for unstandardized model
resid(myMod)

### Using broom for fitted and residual values
## Save calculations into data object
dataAug <- augment(myMod, data)

## Examine specific rows and variables of the augmented data
# Select data
dataAug %>%
  # Choose specific rows
  slice(c(1:5, 20, 24:30, 33, 40, 45:50)) %>%
  # Select specific variables
  select(States, .fitted, .resid) %>%
  # Print the table
  kable(caption = "Augmented Data", digits = 2)
```


## Your Turn! 

Estimate the unstandardized regression model with **population size** as the criterion and **total cases** as the predictor.  Name the _**lm**_ object **myMod2**.  Use **broom** to look at the overall model summary and regression coefficients.  Augment the data, and save the augmented data as a new object **datAug2**. 

Note: these Your Turn sections are purely for practice purposes

```{r your_turn_lm}

```

## Scatterplot with Regression Line

We produce scatterplot with a fitted regression line simply using _**ggplot**_ functionalities.

```{r reg_plot}
### Produce the plot
## Save the plot as object
# Specify data and aesthetics
regPlot <- ggplot(data = dataAug, aes(x = Popnsize, y = totalcases)) +
  # Specify point geometry for scatterplot
  geom_point(shape = 1) +
  # Specify smooth geometry for regression line
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F, col = "green") +
  # Specify horizontal line to represent mean value on criterion
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = mean(totalcases)), lty = 2, col = "blue") +
  # Specify smooth geometry for loess line
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = F, col = "red")

### Display regression plot
regPlot

### save plots to folder in project directory
## save a single plot to a file
ggsave(
  ## file path
  here("plots", "regPlot.png"), 
  ## plot object
  plot = regPlot,
  ## dimensions
  units = "in", width = 9, height = 6
)
```

## Your Turn! 

Create a similar ggplot with population size as the criterion and total cases as the predictor.

```{r your_turn_reg_plot}

```
